# Tiny Basic

Created by Hunter Fernandes for Sean Kirkpatrick's Spring 2017 Java Class @ SRJC.

## Extensions to Standard
- Variable names are able to be longer than just one character.
- A trailing comma may optionally be given to `PRINT` to prevent trailing newline from being printed. E.g. `PRINT 3,` -> `3`. Whereas `PRINT 3` -> `3\r\n`.
